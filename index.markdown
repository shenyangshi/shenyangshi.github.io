Hi there, welcome. My name is Shenyang (申阳) Shi (石). Shen(申) is a tradional Chinese indicator of time meaning 3pm to 5pm in a day, while Yang(阳) means sunny. I was born in a sunny afternoon among many of the rainy days in the [1998 Yangtze river flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_China_floods).

I'm a Ph.D. student majoring in particle physics at Columbia University. I'm one of the many dark matter physicists in [XENON collaboration](https://xenonexperiment.org/). We aim to detect the presence of a dark matter particle candidate called [WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle) via a large cryogenic liquid xenon detector buried deep underground in Italy Gran Sasso mountain. My advisor is [Prof. Elena Aprile](https://www.physics.columbia.edu/content/elena-aprile).

I enjoy traveling and photography. I have a general interests towards literature, poem, and oil painting. I held a B.Sc. From Fudan University, Shanghai. You can find my CV [here](/assets/files/ShenyangShiCV.pdf).
