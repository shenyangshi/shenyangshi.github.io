Hi there, welcome. My name is Shenyang (申阳) Shi (石). My first name means my birth time was between 3-5 in a sunny afternoon.

I'm a Ph.D. student majoring in particle physics at Columbia University. I'm one of the many dark matter physicists in [XENON collaboration](https://xenonexperiment.org/). We aim to detect the presence of a dark matter particle candidate called [WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particle) via a large liquid xenon detector buried deep underground in Italy Gran Sasso mountain.

I enjoy traveling, road trip and photography.

I held a B.Sc. From Fudan University, Shanghai.
